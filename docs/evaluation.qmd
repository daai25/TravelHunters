# Evaluation - TravelHunters Project

This report summarizes the evaluation results of the TravelHunters project and documents decisions for further development and deployment of the travel recommendation system.

## Evaluation Workshop Results

**Date**: July 3, 2025  
**Participants**: Leona Kryeziu, Evan Blazo, Joan Felber, Jakub Baranec

### Assessment of Project Results

#### Fulfilled Requirements

- **Data Collection**: Successfully collected and structured >2,800 travel datasets
  - 2,047 hotels from Booking.com
  - 90 activities from GetYourGuide
  - 671 destinations from various sources
- **Global Coverage**: Hotels and activities available from different continents
- **Data Quality**: >95% completeness in critical fields (name, location, rating)
- **Automation**: Fully automated web scraping with pagination implemented
- **System Architecture**: Scalable SQLite database with structured schema

#### Partially Fulfilled Requirements  

- **Geographic Balance**: Europe bias in hotel data (predominantly European cities)
- **Image URLs**: Not all entries have working image URLs
- **Price Formats**: Inconsistent price representation across different sources

#### Unfulfilled Requirements

- **Real-time Data**: Static data collection without live updates
- **User Reviews**: Limited number of user reviews per entry
- **Multi-Language Support**: Only English/German content captured

### Technical Evaluation

   - User behavior modeling

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Web-Scraping Challenges**:
   - Rate-limiting is critical for website stability
   - Robust error-handling prevents data loss
   - Pagination-handling complex but important for completeness

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Early duplicate detection saves resources
   - Uniform data models essential for integration
   - Automated validation reduces manual rework

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - SQLite sufficient for prototyping, PostgreSQL for production
   - Documentation with Quarto very effective
   - Version control for data pipelines important

### Project Management

1. **Agile Development** works well for Data Science projects
2. **Continuous Evaluation** prevents direction changes
3. **Stakeholder Feedback** collect early and regularly

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Website Changes**: Plan regular spider updates
- **Scaling Problems**: Early architecture planning
- **Data Quality**: Implement automated monitoring tools

### Legal Risks  

- **robots.txt Compliance**: Automated verification
- **Rate-Limiting**: Respectful scraping practices
- **Copyright**: Only use publicly available data

### Business Risks

- **Competition**: Focus on unique features and better UX
- **Data Currency**: Establish regular update cycles
- **User Acceptance**: Continuous user testing

## Future Recommendations

### Short-term (1-3 months)

1. **Clean up codebase** and documentation
2. **Automated tests** for all spiders implemented
3. **CI/CD Pipeline** for continuous data updates
4. **Monitoring Dashboard** for data quality

### Medium-term (3-6 months)

1. **Machine Learning Pipeline** for recommendations development
2. **API Gateway** for external data access
3. **Performance Optimization** for larger datasets
4. **International Expansion** of data sources

### Long-term (6-12 months)

1. **Production Web Application** development
2. **Mobile Apps** for iOS and Android
3. **AI-powered Travel Planning** implementation
4. **Partnerships** with travel providers establishment
